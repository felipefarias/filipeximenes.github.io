Summary: What is the difrerence between URL's, URI's and URN's

[URL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_resource_locator), [URI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_resource_identifier) and [URN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_resource_name) are widely used terms when we talk about the web, althought they seem to be the same, they are actualy not. There is a slitght diference between each one of them. Let's take a look at URI's first.
According to wikipedia URI's are:   

```"a uniform resource identifier (URI) is a string of characters used to identify a name of a web resource"```   

The key to understanding is ```a string of characters```, URI's are a concept of how to identify things on the web.   

There are many ways to identify something, for instance, you can use a name, a location or even a descrition of the object. In the web it works just the same, you can identify resourses by name or by it's location. To each identification method we have a name: URN (Uniform Resourse Name) and URL (Uniform Resource Location).   

So, how does each of this look like in real world? Lets say I want to refer to the book "Rework" I can do this using the [ISBN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number) [scheme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_scheme) URN: ```isbn: 0307463745```, which will identify the exact book I'm taking about or in case I want to tell you about where to buy it, I can point to the HTTP [scheme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_scheme) URL: ```http://www.amazon.com/Rework-Jason-Fried/dp/0307463745```.
